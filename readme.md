A fully responsive Personal Portfolio Website for myself to showcase my projects and skills. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS
and, as usual, loaded with an assortment of pre-styled elements. Connect with me :)

My learning was focused on making the use of responsive design prinicples to create a fully responsive website for every device. It involved creating a smooth UX and keeping it to the point for the user to easily see what my skills set is and the things I can build.


## Optimizations
When I will improve this project, I would start by removing unnecessary styles and redundant code for different screen sizes which will improve the performance and the loading speed. I would add the following features -

   1. Adding my resume
   2. Adding GIF to the projects section  
   3. Adding a blog section
              
## Lessons Learned
Responsive Design Principles. Mobile First Designing Strategy and how we can optimize the code for different screen sizes. Using CSS preprocessors like SASS.
